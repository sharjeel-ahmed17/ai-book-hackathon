# Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Educational Excellence
All content must prioritize clarity, accuracy, and accessibility for diverse learning audiences. Content must be factually accurate, peer-reviewed, and presented with appropriate context for different skill levels. Educational value supersedes technical elegance.

### II. Docusaurus-First Documentation
All textbook content must be structured using Docusaurus framework for consistent presentation and publishing. All content follows Docusaurus standards for navigation, styling, and cross-referencing. GitHub Pages deployment ensures global accessibility and version control.

### III. Spec-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All features and content additions must begin with clear specifications using Spec-Kit Plus methodology. Specifications are written and approved → Implementation follows → Verification against original spec. Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced for all code examples and implementations.

### IV. AI-Assisted Development
Leverage Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus for all development tasks to ensure consistency and quality. All AI-generated content must be validated by human reviewers for technical accuracy. Maintain transparency about AI tool usage in development process.

### V. Humanoid Robotics Focus
All content must maintain clear focus on humanoid robotics applications and principles. Content remains relevant to humanoid-specific challenges including locomotion, manipulation, perception, and human-robot interaction. Avoid generic robotics content that doesn't specifically apply to humanoid systems.

### VI. Practical Implementation
All theoretical concepts must be accompanied by practical examples, code implementations, or simulation demonstrations. Theory without implementation has no place in this textbook. Every concept should connect to real-world humanoid robotics applications.

## Content Standards
<!-- Educational content requirements -->

All content must include relevant code examples, diagrams, or simulation results where applicable. Content follows accessibility standards to ensure usability for readers with diverse needs. All external dependencies and libraries must be clearly documented with version requirements.

## Development Workflow
<!-- Process and quality requirements -->

All changes must pass content review by domain experts before merging. Code examples must be tested and verified in appropriate simulation environments. All content changes require specification updates and must reference the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Textbook project goals.

## Governance

This constitution governs all development and content creation for the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Textbook project. All pull requests and reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Any conflicts between this constitution and other practices are resolved in favor of these principles. All team members must acknowledge and adhere to these principles during project participation.
