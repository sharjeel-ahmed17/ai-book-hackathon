# Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Textbook

This project is developing a comprehensive textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics using Docusaurus for documentation and GitHub Pages for publishing. The project follows Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code methodologies for AI-assisted, specification-driven development of learning materials focused on humanoid robotics.

## Project Goals

1. Building a textbook site using Docusaurus and publishing it through GitHub Pages
2. Applying Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code to carry out AI-assisted, specification-driven development
3. Creating learning materials focused on humanoid robotics

## Constitution

This project is governed by the principles outlined in the [Project Constitution](.specify/memory/constitution.md), which emphasizes:
- Educational Excellence
- Docusaurus-First Documentation
- Spec-Driven Development
- AI-Assisted Development
- Humanoid Robotics Focus
- Practical Implementation
