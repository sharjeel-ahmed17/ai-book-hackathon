## Prompt

execute my plan

## Response snapshot

Completed the planning phase for the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Textbook and Docusaurus setup. Created comprehensive plan.md with technical context and constitution check, research.md with technical decisions, data-model.md defining key entities, API contracts for potential future functionality, and quickstart.md for onboarding. All constitution principles verified and satisfied.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established complete planning artifacts for textbook structure and Docusaurus implementation
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (planning task)
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts, and quickstart.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for task generation with /sp.tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Planning phase completed successfully with all required artifacts

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Generate implementation tasks
