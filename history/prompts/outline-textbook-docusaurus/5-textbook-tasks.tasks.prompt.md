## Prompt


## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task list for the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Textbook project with 3 user stories organized in phases. Created 31 specific tasks across setup, foundational, and user story phases with proper parallelization markers and story labels. Tasks follow the checklist format with IDs, story labels, and file paths.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established complete task breakdown for textbook implementation following curriculum structure
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (task generation)
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with organized task list
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation with /sp.implement
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks properly organized by user story with dependencies and parallelization opportunities

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin task implementation
