# Platform Setup Guides

This section provides detailed instructions for setting up your development environment for the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics course. You can choose from three platform options based on your available resources and preferences.

## Available Platforms

1. **Digital Twin Workstation**: A local development environment with simulation capabilities
2. **Physical AI Edge Kit**: A physical hardware kit for hands-on experience
3. **Cloud-Native Environment**: A cloud-based development environment

## Choosing Your Platform

Each platform option has its advantages:

- **Digital Twin Workstation**: Best for development and testing without physical hardware
- **Physical AI Edge Kit**: Best for real-world testing and validation
- **Cloud-Native Environment**: Best for collaborative development and scalability

Choose the platform that best fits your needs and resources. All course content is designed to work with any of these platforms.
