# Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid Pipeline

This capstone project integrates all concepts learned throughout the course to build an autonomous humanoid pipeline that processes speech commands and executes complex tasks involving planning, navigation, perception, and manipulation.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this capstone, you will:
- Integrate all course concepts into a cohesive system
- Build an end-to-end autonomous humanoid pipeline
- Implement speech recognition and natural language processing
- Combine planning, navigation, perception, and manipulation
- Test and validate the complete system

## Project Components

The autonomous humanoid pipeline includes:
- **Speech Recognition**: Processing natural language commands
- **Planning**: High-level task planning and decomposition
- **Navigation**: Path planning and locomotion
- **Perception**: Object detection and scene understanding
- **Manipulation**: Grasping and object interaction

## Prerequisites

- Complete understanding of all previous course sections
- Integration of all platform components
- Testing and validation experience
